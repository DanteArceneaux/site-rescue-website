# 🔍 Deployment Verification

I've attempted to push your code to GitHub. Here's how to verify everything worked:

## ✅ Step 1: Check GitHub Repository

I've opened this URL in your browser:
https://github.com/dantearcene/site-rescue-website

**What you should see:**
- ✅ Repository name: **site-rescue-website**
- ✅ Files visible:
  - `website/` folder (with index.html, style.css, script.js)
  - `.gitignore`
  - `README.md`
  - Email automation scripts
  - Lead generation bot files
  - Various markdown documentation files

**If the page shows "404":**
- The repository wasn't created
- Need to troubleshoot the Git push

**If you see the files:**
- ✅ SUCCESS! Code is on GitHub
- ✅ Ready to connect to Netlify

---

## ✅ Step 2: Verify Netlify Connection

Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/zesty-dodol-376e53/configuration/deploys

**Current Status Check:**
- Look for "Repository: Not linked" → Needs connection
- OR "Connected to GitHub" → Already done!

**To Connect:**
1. Click **"Link repository"**
2. Select **GitHub**
3. Choose **site-rescue-website**
4. Configure:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Base directory: `website`
   - Publish directory: `website`
5. Click **"Deploy site"**

---

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Live Site

After Netlify connection (~30 seconds), check:
https://zesty-dodol-376e53.netlify.app/#pricing

**Look for:**
- ✅ Full Redesign shows **$1,500** (not $300)
- ✅ Care Plan shows **$125/mo** (not $50/mo)
- ✅ Growth Plan shows **$350/mo** (4th pricing card)
